The User Experience Guide for Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Systems helps VHA project teams create easy-to-use health information technology (HIT) systems by focusing on users and their needs. 
- Explore user experience (UX) and learn how could consideration of a user's perceptions and responses to a system, product, or service can be leveraged to improve design. 
- Incorporate principles and practices of human-centered design (HCD) an approach to systems design and development that aims to make interactive systems more usable.
- Improve the value of your products.
